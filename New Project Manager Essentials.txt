# NEW PROJECT MANAGER ESSENTIALS
--------------------------------
For the new project manager, the essentials  – what you need to know to undertake your new responsibilities - are not always obvious. 

Project management involves a lot of moving parts:
. In this course, you’ll learn some of the foundational concepts, such as what a project and its project environment and scope are. 
. You'll learn what you’ll be responsible for, and things you’ll need to understand before planning begins. 
. You’ll also learn where to go to access useful information and how to identify the different types of people who will have an interest in the project – its stakeholders.

For the new project manager, the essentials. What you need to know to undertake your new responsibilitiesare not always obvious. There are so many moving parts.

It can be hard to know where to begin. In this course, you'll learn:

. the characteristics that define a project and 

. what the environment and scope of a project are. 

. You'll also learn what your responsibilities are, and what you need to understand before who'll be involved in the project, its stakeholders, and where to go to access useful information.

* What makes a project
----------------------
What exactly is a project? And how does it differ from what you're doing everyday already? This may seem like a simple question with a simple answer. But until you've been the one trying 
to jump start a business project and then keep it moving forward, there's more to it than you might realize.

You need to start at the beginning. In business, projects often become necessary when a need arises that falls outside of your daily work routine. **** GAZPROM PROJECT ****

Say, your team meets every month to review work performance, and discuss ideas for improving the workflow. These monthly meetings are not a project. They're part of the normal operations
of the business and are ongoing and non specific to any one topic or business need. 

But perhaps at one of these monthly meetings, you make the point that within your department, you find the decision making process for certain activities lacks clarity, upper management 
agree, and now you find yourself tasked with establishing a set of more workable processes for your team to follow. 

. This is signed off with a deadline for the end of the quarter. So, in a finite amount of time, you must create new procedures for your team's future decision making. 

Now, you have a project:

	. no matter how big or small. For something to be considered a project, it must be a temporary, time-bound endeavor. **** GAZPROM PROJECT **** (If the Gazprom project doesn't have 
	very clear definined deadline the project is set up to fail by definition from the very beginnint, and that applies to other ongoing project in RR Technologies).

	. Another general characteristic is that typically, a project creates a new product, service, or outcome. **** GAZPROM PROJECT **** (Here the definition is clearly set up).

Take the Egyptian pyramids for an obvious example, they took time, resources, and a great deal of human effort to provide a beautiful protected burial site for the pharaohs. They 
represent the outcome of a project. As a more modest business-related example, suppose during one of your HR department's monthly meetings, a recommendation is made for the company to 
spend more time and resources to improve employee onboarding. The team believes that new employees need to better understand the company goals and workflows, and how their respective 
jobs align with the company's key initiatives. 

Upper management sign off on the idea and so, it becomes a project. 

	. It's a project because it hasa specific outcome, creating an addition to the employees orientation program, to focus more on company goals and in theory, lead to better overall
	productivity and job performance. **** GAZPROM PROJECT **** (The specific outcome is the software product that fullfills the requirements).


Using time and resources, a project should create something that didn't exist before. But, there's yet another characteristic to consider. 

	. A project must meet a business need. This need can come from many sources, such as a new technology, a change in industry regulations, or a customer request. 
	**** GAZPROM PROJECT **** (In the case of our project, the business need is clearly defined).

	For example, if customer feedback suggests significant support for a live chat option on your web site, then maybe that has identified a business need. Or, if employees 
	consistently complain about how time consuming virtual work collaborations can be, perhaps this identifies the need for improvements in the system's network.

	The business need, whatever it may be, is both the foundation and the justification of the project. It should be the primary focus around which all the other elements of the 
	project revolve. **** GAZPROM PROJECT **** (Please don't forget to take this into consideration for the day of the presentation in front of Gazprom).


	Whatever the time frame, whatever the desired outcome, the business need is the characteristic that must drive the project.

* Where projects come from
--------------------------
New projects aren't launched on a whim. Experienced leaders know that their business reasons for starting a project need to be very clear. 

	. Valuable time and resources are at stake and must be used wisely. 

	. Before you're handed a project to lead, its value and utility have been assessed and justified. 

	. Business reasons for undertaking a project are generally tangible. Meaning that it's possible to place a monetary value on the expected outcome. 

	. Financial gain is something that you can see and you can touch. So it's no surprise that financial considerations are often the reason for undertaking projects in business.

	. Such economic factors can include:
		. increased revenues, 
		. improved profit margins,
		. cost savings
		. and even things like tax considerations and market volatility.

Say, a company's shipping costs are rising. A team is assembled to analyze the shipping process and look for ways to reduce costs. They discover that their warehouses are still issuing 
physical picking tickets. They then suggest an automated process, requiring the purchase of new software and inventory devices. 

Despite the initial costs, the financial gain that will be realized from the process change is clear, it's tangible, and the project gets approved. 

	. Another tangible reason for undertaking a project is to create a new asset. This is even clearer if the asset you're creating has value in and of itself. 

If, for example, your project is to design and build a new piece of machinery that will help your manufacturing company increase its output, then that increased output has the potential to
support expanded sales and to increase profits. 

	. Customer demand is another powerful business reason for undertaking a project.

Identifying customer needs, even as they're changing, can mean the difference between the success and failure of a project. **** GAZPROM PROJECT **** (It's necessary to take this into 
consideration and emphazise this when talking with Gazprom).

Consider the smartphone industry, each new iteration that comes on the market represents a project undertaken to produce something new. That something then brings value to the company by 
meeting a customer need. A need that's always in flux.

Smartphones get bigger. They get smaller. They get faster and smarter. 

Each new feature is an attempt to keep pace with customer need, which in turn translates into an increase in customer demand.

Business reasons can also be intangible.

	. Improving employee morale, **** RR TECHNOLOGIES **** (We definitely need to work on this to improve the corporate culture of the company.  We can't continue working as we are
	doing). 
	
	. better brand recognition, or

	. creating customer goodwill, are examples of intangible value.

You may not be able to quantify these reasons in monetary terms, but this doesn't mean they aren't valuable. A company picnic might seem frivolous, but it can help employees feel valued 
and thus, more motivated in their job. 

Or if your company were to sponsor an event in the local community, this creates community goodwill and publicity.  

It enhances your company's reputation and possibly creates further customer demand.

It's hard to quantify the value of the event in financial terms, but its intangible benefits are recognized, thus leading to an approved project.

Projects can require a lot of time, effort, and money.

That's why having solid business reasons is so essential to getting a project off the ground.

* Project Manager Responsibilities
----------------------------------
As a project manager, you're responsible for all of the project's moving parts and keeping them connected. A small change to one will have a domino effect on the others. 

Having a clear understanding of the key responsibilities involved in leading a project will help keep all the interrelated parts working together in harmony.

Defining the scope of the project is one of these key responsibilities.

	. The scope is what a project should specifically include and what it shouldn't include. **** GAZPROM PROJECT **** (Is the scope of the project already clearly defined)?

Bear in mind that what everyone visualizes for the project might be different. So defining the scope helps get your team working off the same page, right from the start. And by specifying 
the exact features of the product or service that's being created, you'll prevent misunderstandings that could drain precious time and effort later. **** GAZPROM PROJECT ****
(We cannot continue working with this system of demo creations, and adding more and more features in each iteration without any order an planning because this is expensive, and time
consuming).

	. Another key responsibility is managing the project budget. A detailed plan of how money will be spent should include a reserve fund to cover the unexpected events that often 
	sidetrack your project. 

	. There is also the schedule. Because time is money. The schedule helps keep things on track. The schedule includes the start date, dates for key milestones, and the end date of 
	your project. **** GAZPROM PROJECT **** (Here we are failing, we are not meeting the deadlines, there are not deadlines due to the nature of the demos).

	The schedule can be further broken down into specific activities, to make things more manageable. Think of the 
		. scope, 

		. budget,

		. and schedule as interrelated wheels. The project needs all of them moving together in tandem to get to where you want to go. 

As the project leader, you must also ensure that quality standards are being met. Referring to the project scope as a guide can help you to focus on the targeted outcomes.
**** GAZPROM PROJECT **** The technical leader will be in charge of this task.

Quality checks are needed to make sure that all the features are there and in good working order as agreed. 

		. You'll also handle the project resources. This means managing the people, material, and equipment needed to do the work.

		. And in every project there's an element of risk involved. The risks are thepotential events that might negatively affect your project.
		**** GAZPROM PROJECT **** (For example developer who are quitting their jobs in the company, creation of silos of information). 

Managing the fallout from equipment failure or cost overruns is a project manager's responsibility.

Part of your plan should include budget and time contingencies to take the risks into account. These six areas:

	. scope, 
	. budget, 
	. schedule, 
	. quality, 
	. resources, and
	. risks 

represent the moving parts that you must coordinate. 

It is also the case that any one or all these areas can be constraints on your project.

A constraint is something that is a limiting factor. It will affect the way you need to carry out the work. If you had an unlimited budget and unlimited time, then you could sit back and 
relax. 

But coordinating multiple areas under tight constraints is a big challenge. 

Imagine, right in the middle of the project, you're told the completion date must move forward, as key team members will be needed to work on something else. **** GAZPROM PROJECT ****
(This is exactly what is happening in the project, and due to the fact that only one developer that is not delegating any work to any other developers is doing everything, the Demo was 
delayed and we need to solve this).

How can you save time?

Do you factor in longer daily working hours with overtime cost seating into the reserve? That's one possible solution.

Or are there aspects of the project that could be scaled back to save time? **** GAZPROM PROJECT **** (This is exactly what happened, the demo doesn't have all the features that the
directors of the company would like to show to the client, due to the lack of management).

As project manager, it's up to you to work with the team and stakeholders to identify and choose the best options to keep the project's wheel spinning.
